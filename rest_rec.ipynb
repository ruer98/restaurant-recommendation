    "## Project purpose\n",
    "The goal of this project was to build several several different types of recommendation systems in order to better understand how they work through practice. In my Marketing Analytics course, we covered some of the advantages of recommendation systems. However, we never put these ideas into practice. In this application with restaurants, customers tend to seek out new culinary experiences that fit their requirements. With a recommendation system, business value can be generated via taking a cut of profits from restaurants generated by generating new customers with a higher customer retention and order value assuming that the recommendations are high-quality. This is a win-win for businesses and customers as customers receive an enhanced dining experience from a recommendation tailored towards them. In this way, value is generated for everyone: the company with the recommendation system, the restaurants, and the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of restaurants, recommendation engines are extremely useful for driving web traffic and providing relevant content such as advertisements to users. A notable example is Google, which is valued at over \\$1 trillion and is essentially a recommendation system that makes its money from ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Data\n",
    "The data was taken from a small Kaggle competition named \"Restaurant Recommendation Challenge.\" The original competition was to build a recommendation engine to which restaurants customers are most likely to order given \"customer location\", \"restaurant information\", and \"customer order history\". However, I was more interested in learning about building recommendation engines, so I did not follow these rules. Instead, I have taken 2 datasets, orders.csv and vendors.csv, and ignored the other provided training and testing datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Orders.csv is 135,303 rows and 26 columns. Some of these columns are:\n",
    "1. Order amount\n",
    "2. Count of items in order\n",
    "3. Customer ID\n",
    "4. Vendor ID\n",
    "5. Promo code\n",

    "# Modeling\n",
    "---\n",
    "There are 2 ways to make recommendations: model-driven approaches and heuristics approaches. Model-driven apporaches are creating models using some form of attributes or behavior of the restaurant or customers. It is important to note that this is highly dependent on the analyst's ability to determine what to model. I decided not to pursue this approach process due to limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristics approaches uses a simple rule of thumb approach to making recommendations. From \"stated\" preference data, such as customer ratings, we can use the collaborative filtering process. From \"revealed\" preference data, such as the customer's purchase history, we can attempt a market basket analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Matrix Factorization Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "In collaborative filtering, we are trying to answer the question: for each of the customers who left at least one rating, can we recommend other restaurants that they have not yet rated?\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of data preparation, the biggest problem was that data was very sparse. Most customers did not rate any restaurants, and more than half of the ratings were recorded as zero, which was not usable. Thus, after removing all the unusable data, I had about 20k out of 135k orders. There were 7,726 customers who rated at least once, which is about 28% of all the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix factorization method I used was SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). "

The advantages of this approaches is that training of the model is fast, it has the ability to learn the complex target functions, and is also very effective in preserving information. For disadvantages, this model can beslow while executing queries, which ended up being a major hindrance during testing.\n",

    "Now, I train the model on the whole dataset with a pivot table where:\n",
    "- each row is a vendor_id\n",
    "- each column is a customer_id\n",
    "- vendor_rating are in the table\n",
    "\n",
    "I use cosine similarity and euclidean distance to find the distance between similar restaurants and then the model returns the 5 most similar restaurants.\n",

    "## 4. Market Basket Analysis\n",
    "For Market basket, the question is to see if I can recommend a restaurant that the customer has never ordered before. I am assuming that the customer's preferencess stay the same over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first create a one-hot table with all customers and all restaurants, where the cell values were \"True\" if the customer had at least one order, and \"False\" if the customer had never ordered from the restaurant. There are instances where customers had multiple orders from the same restaurant, but I counted them once."

    "## 5. Benchmarking\n",
    "To measure the performance of recommendation systems, the idea is to use a metric called \"mean average precision at k\" or MAP@K. MAP is useful for recommender algorithms if you are treating the recommendation like a ranking task. This makes sense in this case because a user of our recommendation system has limited time and attention, and so probably would only want to know the top 5 restaurants and also which recommendations we are most confident in. For this to work, we have to somehow measure if our recommendation system gives a \"correct\" or \"relevant\" recommendation that a customer would like. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, precision is the (# correct positives / # predicted positives). Translating this to our recommendation system, our recommder system precision is (# of our recommendations that are relevant / # items we recommended). Average precision for N recommendations is shown by the formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\textrm{AP@N} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k=1}^N \\textrm{($P(k)$ if $k^{th}$ item was relevant)} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k=1}^N P(k)\\cdot rel(k),\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost there. Lastly, the \"at K\" part of the metric means that you only consider the mean average precision for the subset of your recommendations from rank 1 through rank k. In our case, our top 5 ranked recommendations, or k=5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, in order to do this we would need some way to know if customers liked the recommendation. To measure this, the company would need to ask a customer if they liked or disliked their recommendation, and from their calculate the MAP@K to calculate relevant performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, I learned a great deal about the different types of recommendation systems and how they would be applied in real life. For the subjective side of recommendation system performance, here is what I learned:\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "---\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Results are intuitive and easy to understand\n",
    "- Can improve as more data is gathered\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Limited to only customers who has previously rated restaurants (can solve this by implementing a recommendation rule for new users such as recommending highest rated restaurant)\n",
    "- Data is likely to be very sparse\n",
    "\n",
    "### Market Basket Analysis\n",
    "---\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Can be applied to all customers who previously made purchases\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Requires more computing power than collaborative filtering, more so as size increases (A possible solution could be Amazon's simpler approach)\n",
    "- In hindsight, not exactly intended for this type of analysis due to making the assumption that purchase history is concurrent implying that preferences are not changing\n",
    "\n",
    "However, both of these methods offer improvements over recommending only the highest rated restaurants. Overall, the heuristics approach would most likely outperform the model-driven approach as model-driven relies on gathering more relevant data to improve, while heuristics only needs more customers to rate restaurants. This is also the proven choice of other recommendation systems such as YouTube which factors in watch time and other factors compared to using restaurant ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight, I could have used a less sparse dataset to get more reliable results are too few people replied, and there were not enough multiple ratings. The quality of the analysis also depends on the available resources and personnel implemting such as recommender system. For further analysis, I could have compared recommendation to a variety of models such as decision trees, KNN, etc. I could have also split the dataset into train/test sets and used another rule to get actual values too benchmark model performance. Lastly, I could perform a market basket analysis on the types of food ordered too, which I thought might be interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose was that I could learn more about recommendation systems. In that sense, I feel that I have succeeded. In the future, however, starting from the basics such as asking what metrics will I measure performance with, if a recommender system is the right solution for a problem, and if I can collect quality data, will ensure a smoother production pipeline and overall result."
